# LLM Integration Testing Framework - Implementation Prompt Plan (Non TDD approach)

This document outlines a step-by-step set of prompts for implementing the LLM Integration Testing Framework. Each prompt builds on the previous ones to create a cohesive, well-structured project.

## Project Blueprint Overview

The LLM Integration Testing Framework consists of several core components:

3. **Strategy Generator** - Recommends testing strategies
4. **LLM Analyzer** - Enhances analysis with AI
5. **Report Generator** - Creates visualizations and reports
6. **Command Line Interface** - Provides user interaction

The implementation plan follows an incremental approach, building each component in small, testable steps.
