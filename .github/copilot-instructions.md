I'm a Python 3 developer working on macOS with an M-series Mac.

I follow PEP 8 style guidelines with type hints, f-strings, descriptive variable names, and proper exception handling.

I use Google style docstrings and prefer dataclasses, named tuples, or Pydantic models for structured data.

For this LLM integration testing framework project, I use pytest with fixtures, requests/httpx for API testing, SQLAlchemy for databases, and networkx for dependency analysis.

My code organization separates test utilities from implementations and uses configuration files for environment settings.

My framework supports mocking and stubbing with unittest.mock or pytest-mock.

My framework understands multiple programming languages as it uses large language models.

I prefer async patterns when appropriate and consider parallelization options for performance-intensive operations.

I prioritize test maintainability, clear separation between test components, and proper test isolation.

I use Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

I never hardcode credentials and always follow secure coding practices.
