Improve development workflow and environment handling

- Enhance Makefile with better virtual environment management (.venv instead of venv)
- Add new Makefile targets: update-deps and run-llm for easier workflow
- Make API key optional when running in test mode
- Improve environment file detection and error handling
- Update documentation with python3 command examples and new Makefile targets
- Fix report path output format in main.py
- Add missing networkx import in analyzer.py

These changes make the framework more robust for development and testing,
with clearer separation between test mode and production usage.
