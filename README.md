# README: Project proj_llm_integration_test_framework

Project Goals:
Develop a comprehensive and scalable integration testing framework that ensures the seamless interaction between various system components.
Automate the testing process to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and minimize human error.
Enhance the quality assurance process by providing reliable and repeatable test results.
Ensure the framework is flexible enough to adapt to different environments, technologies, and project requirements.

Project Subject:
The project focuses on the creation of an integration testing framework designed to validate the interaction and compatibility of different software modules and services within a system. This framework will serve as a critical tool in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that all components work together as expected.

Problem Statement:
Many organizations face challenges in efficiently testing the integration of software components, which can lead to delays, increased costs, and reduced software quality. This project aims to solve these issues by providing a robust framework that automates integration testing processes, thus improving the reliability and speed of software delivery without compromising quality.
